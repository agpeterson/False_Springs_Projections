# False Spring Projections

Spatiotemporal patterns of green-up dates, last spring freezes, and false springs are modeled across the contiguous United States from 1950 to 2099 using the MACAv2-METDATA dataset.

## I. Introduction
There is evidence that the timing of plant green-up (GU), observable across plant species through bud-burst, leaf-out, and flowering, has advanced earlier in the year across the globe coincident with a changing climate [Parmesan and Yohe 2002; Cleland et al. 2007]. The satellite-observable "green wave" of GU sweeps pole-ward as winter transitions to spring with increases in temperature and photoperiod, bringing about direct changes in ecologic and physical systems across multiple scales. Regional- and continental-scale GU directly modifies global atmospheric carbon concentrations and albedo, while landscape-scale GU modifies local surface energy budgets, evapotranspiration, and nutrient cycling [Cannell and Smith 1986; Schwartz 1993; Gu et al. 2008]. GU is a key ecological indicator and linked with animal life cycles, insect emergence, and bird migration patterns [Polgar and Primack 2011]. While advances in the timing of GU with warming may prove advantageous for temperature-responsive plant communities by lengthening the growing season, asynchrony arising from phenological mismatches may result in negative impacts across these systems and dynamics [Gu et al. 2008; Zipkin et al. 2012; Moller 2013].

DISCUSS SPRING TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY AND COLD EXTREMES. Freeze events throughout the spring season are known to damage sensitive tissue exposed through the GU process through events termed false springs [CITATION]. False spring events are characterized by //abnormally warm meteorological conditions giving rise to premature plant GU, followed (Doesn’t have to be abnormally warm, simply just GU followed by freeze; however you can/should allude to the notion of warming promoting earlier GU and leaving veg potentially vulnerable to freeze)// by a subsequent freeze or series of freezes [Cannell and Smith 1986]. False spring events can induce extensive damage or mortality to the sensitive developing tissue exposed through the GU process, although physiologic damage varies amongst plant individuals, species, and communities. Additionally, widespread false springs observed in 2007 across the southeastern U.S. event and in 2012 across the Midwestern U.S. lead to broader impacts in ecosystem structures and dynamics including reduced ecosystem productivity and vigor, constrained nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration in addition to direct impacts to agricultural yields [Gu et al. 2008; Knudson 2012].

Peterson and Abatzoglou [2014] highlighted //an asymmetric advancement of plant GU and freeze events across (Change)//the contiguous U.S from 1920-2013 and subsequent decline in false spring events despite the more recent widespread events in 2007 and 2012. [Should say something about sensitivity, implying that this is due to warming///  then need to state why we needed to do this study; e.g., why couldn’t we just use results from sensitivity analysis] Continued and accelerated climate change throughout the 21st century may paradoxically increase cold damage or mortality risks.. Plants will continue to prematurely break winter dormancy and undertake photosynthesis and respiration coincident with additional early-year warmth, and high-amplitude synoptic shifts in meteorological regimes are likely to persist in the coming decades [Francis and Vavrus 2012]. It is relevant to examine how plant GU, freeze events, and false springs are likely to respond to climate change through the 21st century. [Is there a hypothesis you want to test?  It might be good to state this]

This study examines changes in the timing of climatological plant GU, LSF, and false spring frequency in response to projected climate change across the contiguous U.S over the 21st century. To overcome the limitations of sensitivity analyses as detailed in Peterson and Abatzoglou [2014], we employ high-resolution global climate model (GCM) temperature data.


## II. Methods
Daily minimum temperature was acquired from twenty global climate models (GCMs) participating in the fifth phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) [Taylor et al. 2012] for runs using both historical forcing (1950-2005) and future forcing (2006-2099), with the latter using Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 (RCP4.5) and 8.5 (RCP8.5). Daily GCM output was statistically downscaled using the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs 
(MACA, Abatzoglou and Brown [2012]) and the gridded surface meteorological training dataset of Abatzoglou [2013].

Plant GU was modeled using the Growing Season Index (GSI) following Jolly et al. [2005] and Peterson & Abatzoglou [2014]. This empirical phenological model produces an index bounded by 0 and 1 indicating plant foliage as confined by climatic limits by integrating the weighted effects of minimum temperature, photoperiod, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and is well-suited to large spatiotemporal analyses, rather than being parameterized for any specific species 
or ecoregion [Jolly et al. 2005]. VPD was determined to be a non-limiting factor in observed plant GU across the contiguous US and was held at a non-constraining value [Supplemental material]. Following Peterson and Abatzoglou [2014], GU was defined as the first calendar day of each year where the 21-day moving average of GSI ≥ 0.5.

The last spring freeze (LSF) was defined as the last calendar day of the year prior to 1 July with minimum temperatures ≤ -2.2°C [Schwartz et al. 2006; Peterson & Abatzoglou 2014]. //This threshold is known to induce cold damage and mortality across plant individuals, communities, and species [CITATION] (Put something in the introduction)//. False springs were derived using a binary classification for each year where a LSF occurs at least 7-days following GU. A false spring exposure index (FSEI) was calculated as the percent of years in a given period experiencing false springs [Peterson & Abatzoglou 2014].

The //GSI model, LSF threshold, and FSEI are derived for all grid points for all years 1950-2099 across all twenty models and two RCPs included in the MACA-METDATAv2 dataset (Rephrase; don't need to refer to MACA)//. The historical values (1950-2005) are averaged and used as reference values from which changes for two future climatological periods - mid-century, corresponding to 2040-2069, and late-century, corresponding to 2070-2099 - are derived. [DISCUSS ECOREGION DIVISIONS - http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/ecoregions/products/map-ecoregions-united-states/ ] For brevity, we report the multi-model mean values for GU, LSF, and FSEI. //Need to say something about how you examine model spread, and how you examine significant differences//


## III. Results
The multi-model mean GU date, LSF date, and FSEI for the reference period 1950-2005 mirror the latitudinal, elevation, and maritime controls reported by previous research (Figure 1) [e.g., Schwartz et al. 2006; Peterson & Abatzoglou 2014] and show general agreement with values derived from the baseline observed gridded meteorological dataset [Supplemental material]. Asynchrony between historic climatological GU and LSF dates are apparent across much of the U.S., captured in the climatological FSEI. Mediterranean, Tropical-Subtropical, and Marine ecoregions experienced limited false spring exposure, while high-elevation and interior regions including Temperate Desert and Hot Continental Regime Mountain ecoregions experienced higher false spring exposure (Table 1). Individual GCM output shows similar historic GU dates aggregated across ecoregions, but more variable historic LSF dates. The range of modeled LSF dates is greatest in mountainous and topographically complex areas. As a result, the range of modeled FSEI is also greatest in these areas.

Climatological GU and LSF dates are projected to advance earlier in the year throughout the 21st century across the contiguous U.S. (Figure 2). Distinct patterns of changes in GU and LSF are evident. In general, mountain ecoregions (including Temperature Desert, Temperature Steppe, and Tropical-Subtropical Regime Mountains) exhibit the most acute advancement in mean GU and LSF (Table 2). The magnitude of LSF advancement is especially notable in these areas, shifting more than 30 days earlier in the year in the late 21st century. Maritime areas along the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Southern Eastern Seaboard are projected to see relatively minor shifts in GU, corresponding to the photoperiod limits imposed by the GSI model, though . LSF, however, is projected to advance in these regions. There is additional asymmetry between projected GU and LSF changes across the interior and northeastern areas of the U.S., with GU advancing relative to LSF, highlighting the paradoxical increased cold damage risk arising from climate change.


## Notes & To-do's
- Sensitivity analysis of +3C to explain changes in GU and LSF due to local climatology.
- SD of 30 days after historic and future mean GU to explain FS.
- Overlay ecoregion shapefile on maps.
- Does shifting GU earlier in the year move it to increased variability?
